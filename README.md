# Elliot-Forest
For Project to Fully Function, please run in Unreal Engine 5.3+. Some levels will not be built properly if this step is not followed.

The full prototype consists of a fully functioning forest visualization that employs data-driven and procedural methods to generate forests in a revolutionary way. Including the capability to visualize forests under different restoration techniques, times, and weather conditions.
